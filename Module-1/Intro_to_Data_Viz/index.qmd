## Learning Objectives

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(countdown)
```

## Share a Data Visualization

-   Form groups of 2-3.
-   Start by reintroducing yourself to your group.
-   Pick one group member to start.
-   As a group, look at the starting group member's data visualization and discuss the following.
    -   What story does the visualization tell?
    -   What do you find clear or confusing about this visualization?
    -   Who do you think the intended audience is, and how does that shape the design?
-   Be sure to leave enough time to repeat the above discussion for each group member's visualization.

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes=6)
```

## Consider the purpose of a data visualization

-   Who is it for?

-   What will the graphic(s) be used for?

-   Exploratory vs. publication ready
