## Data Wrangling

the process of converting messy, untidy data into a tidy format, making it suitable for data visualization and analysis

-   **Data is often messy:** Real-world data is rarely provided in a tidy format.

-   **Industry challenges:** Many industries have poorly designed data structures, requiring data preparation before visualization.

-   **Rarely tidy datasets:** It is uncommon to receive a dataset that is already tidy.

## Data Structure and Vocabulary

::::: columns
::: column
Datasets used in statistical analyses are generally made up of **rows** and **columns**.

-   Datasets contain a collection of **values**.

-   Each value belongs to a **variable** and an **observation.**

    -   A **variable** contains all the values of a specific attribute or characteristic.

    -   An **observation** contains all of the values that correspond to specific individual or unit on which information was collected.

## Tidy Data

:::::: columns
::: column
Tidy data is a structured format that aligns the organization of a dataset with its underlying meaning. In tidy data:

-   **Each variable has its own column:** Every column in the dataset corresponds to a specific variable or attribute.

-   **Each observation has its own row:** Every row captures a single observation or data entry.

-   **Each cell contains a single value:** Each cell holds one distinct piece of information for a particular variable and observation.

| Mary Johnson | b         | 1      |

In many industries, data are often imported using SQL to create narrower datasets. While we won’t cover SQL in this course, it’s a valuable skill to learn in the future. For now, we’ll focus on using R to manipulate and create subset datasets from larger datasets for focused analysis.

## Causes of Untidy Data

-   Column headers are values, not variable names

-   Multiple variables stored in one column

-   Variables are stored in both rows and columns

-   Multiple types in one datasets

-   One type in multiple datasets

## Other Messy Data Issues

-   Incorrect/Inconsistent/Unrecognized Dates

-   Void or Misspelled Variables

## Tidy Tools

Once your data are in a tidy format, you can easily use tidy tools (tools that take tidy data as input):

-   data manipulation functions (e.g.`filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`)
-   modeling functions (e.g. `lm()`)
-   **visualization functions** (e.g. `ggplot()`)
